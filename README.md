Hey there! 

I am a PhD candidate in **theoretical evolutionary biology** at the University of Groningen, in the Netherlands, where I am also temporarily a lecturer in evolutionary biology. 

That means I make and play with computational models that describe the evolution of species, to help us understand a bit better how biological diversity is generated in the real world. I run a variety of projects, from reconstructing the history of changes in plumage color in birds-of-paradise to predicting patterns left in the genome when two species form. 

Check out this [dashboard](https://github.com/rscherrer/dashboard) for an overview of the most recent projects!

And if you're VIP, you can access the [Supervisor Corner](https://github.com/rscherrer/supervisor-corner) with links to unfinished manuscripts.

Cheers, Raph
